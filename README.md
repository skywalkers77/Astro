# üöÄ AstroRAG

ASTRO is a futuristic, space-themed web application serving as a front-end for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI. It enables users to query a specialized knowledge base‚ÄîNASA bioscience research‚Äîand receive AI-generated answers grounded in source documents.

The user journey starts with a visually stunning, animated landing page and transitions into a clean, intuitive chat interface.
