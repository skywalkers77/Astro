# üöÄ ASTRO - AI Research Engine

ASTRO is a futuristic, space-themed web application serving as a front-end for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI. It enables users to query a specialized knowledge base‚ÄîNASA bioscience research‚Äîand receive AI-generated answers grounded in source documents.

The user journey starts with a visually stunning, animated landing page and transitions into a clean, intuitive chat interface.

## üîß Configuration

Primary configuration variables are located at the top of `App.js`:

```javascript
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://rag-ai-tutorial.hemanth3292.workers.dev/query';
const TOP_K = 10;
const SCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.5;
```

- **API_ENDPOINT**: Backend API URL for queries.
- **TOP_K**: Number of source documents to retrieve.
- **SCORE_THRESHOLD**: Score threshold for "High" relevance (final rating set by backend in `sourceDetails`).

---

## üîå API Endpoint

The frontend communicates with a backend service via GET requests:

- **Endpoint**: `https://rag-ai-tutorial.hemanth3292.workers.dev/query`
- **Method**: GET

**Query Parameters:**

- `query` (string): User's question (URL-encoded)
- `top_k` (integer): Number of source documents to return
- `mode` (string): One of:
  - `'db-only'`: Search internal knowledge base only
  - `'hybrid'`: Augment search with external web results
